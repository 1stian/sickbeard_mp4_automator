[Installation Instructions]
1. Open Sickbeard's config.ini in sickbeard and set your "extra_scripts" value in the general section to the full path to postConversion.bat using double backslashes (C:\\Scripts\\postConversion.cmd). Make sure this is done while Sickbeard is not running or it will be reverted.
2. Open tvdb_mp4.ini and set the variables:
         ip = probably localhost
         port = sickbeard port (8081)
         ssl = 1 (if enabled)
         api_key = Set this to your sickbeard API key (options -> general, enable API in sickbeard to get this key)
         ffmpeg = Path to FFMPEG.exe
         ffprobe = Path to FFPROBE.exe
3. OPTIONAL - If you're using SAB, set your post processing script to sabToSickBeardWithConverter.py - this is not completely needed but gives the added benefit of doing the conversion from mkv to mp4 before Sickbeard sees the file in whatever folder you choose to download things to. It saves having to put in all the API information as well, and prevents the one additional refresh needed normally to have sickbeard see the properly converted file. That being said the postConversion script can handle everything on its own, so this step is just for the added benefits listed.
